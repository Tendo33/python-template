globs: **/*
---
- Follow `doc/AI_TOOLING_STANDARDS.md` for workflow and quality gates.
- Follow `doc/BACKEND_STANDARDS.md` when implementing backend API/service behavior.
- Plan first, implement minimal changes, and verify before completion.
- Backend default: Python 3.10+, uv, ruff, pytest.
- Keep functions typed, explicit, and testable.
- Handle failures explicitly; avoid silent exception swallowing.
