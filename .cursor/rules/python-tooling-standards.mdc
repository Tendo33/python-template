description: Standards for using modern Python tooling including uv, ruff, and pre-commit hooks.
globs: **/pyproject.toml, **/.pre-commit-config.yaml
---
- Use uv for package management and dependency resolution (faster than pip).
- Run uv sync to install dependencies; use uv add/remove for package management.
- Use ruff for both linting and formatting (replaces black, flake8, isort).
- Configure ruff in pyproject.toml with appropriate rules enabled.
- Run ruff format for code formatting; run ruff check for linting.
- Enable automatic fixes with ruff check --fix when appropriate.
- Use pre-commit hooks to enforce code quality before commits.
- Configure pre-commit with ruff, type checking, and other quality checks.
- Run pre-commit install after cloning the project.
- Keep pyproject.toml as the single source of configuration.
- Use hatchling as the build backend for package distribution.
- Define all dependencies in pyproject.toml [project.dependencies].
- Use optional dependencies for dev, test, docs groups.
- Keep uv.lock in version control for reproducible builds.
- Update dependencies regularly with uv lock --upgrade.
