Follow `doc/AI_TOOLING_STANDARDS.md` as the default engineering contract.

- Plan before implementation and keep edits minimal.
- Prefer Python + uv + ruff + pytest for backend tasks.
- For backend API/service design, follow `doc/BACKEND_STANDARDS.md`.
- Use explicit typing and predictable error handling.
- Do not claim completion without relevant verification commands.
- For frontend by default use React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind.
- For UI/UX tasks, run `ui-ux-pro-max` with `--design-system` before coding.
